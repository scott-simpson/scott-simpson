I enjoy growing companies and building the design systems, strategies, and great user experiences necessary to achieve that. My expertise spans the space between design and development. I approach new challenges with the desire to learn, experiment and iterate.

In 2014 I co-founded a startup called [UrbanStems](https://urbanstems.com) which quickly grew into one of the most well-known floral brands in the country. It’s been a challenging experience, but it’s taught me a lot about growing a team, building a business, and creating a brand that customers care about.

For fun I like skiing, [photography](https://instagram.com/scott.dc), mountain biking and traveling. My wife and I have been to over 40 countries and I find that those experiences have brought better insight into my design work.
